                <p>The Hong Kong Youth Professional Training Association Limited was established in 2018. In the early stage of establishment, our main service target was corporate training. We can see the development and growth of young people in recent years. We are convinced that only the changes made after entering their lives are real and effective.</p>

                <p>We believe that as long as we can coordinate and cooperate with partners such as young people and schools in the service, this will help young people grow up in the future.</p>

                <p>In the days to come, we will focus on more training courses for children and young people, with the purpose of providing employment training for future masters. And let the team members understand how the future is constructed on the government. Only then can our society and atmosphere be changed.</p>

              <p>With business development and aging, we started in 2019. Provide suitable services and training for the elderly of different age groups according to their characteristics and needs.</p>

              <p>We firmly believe that allowing young and elders to help them develop their strengths and participate in different activities under the regulations that are still healthy and vigorous will help them enjoy life in the golden years of life and help reduce the deterioration of physical function.</p>

              <p>With the deterioration of the physical function of the elderly and the frailty, they need to be partially/completely dependent on care in their lives. Since subsidized homes have been waiting for many years, caregivers feel powerless at the moment and lack awareness of private homes and worry that the homes will levy other fees at will; therefore, we firmly believe that providing suitable home matching for the frail elderly and carers can help reduce the number of carers At the same time, through counselling, the elders can adapt to the residential life as soon as possible and enable the elders to enjoy their twilight years in the institution.</p>

              <p>As the population ages, Hong Kong is facing a tsunami of dementia. At present, there is one patient in every 10 elderly people aged 70 or above in Hong Kong, and the prevalence rate of people over 85 years old is as high as one-third. The situation cannot be ignored. Establish cognitive reserve for patients and compensate for the loss of cognitive function due to disease; Expose patients to new things and multiple cognitive stimulation, establish new neural connections, reshape brain function and maintain mental and physical health. It is very important to use more brains and stimulate the brain. important. We are convinced that providing meaningful activities and training for patients can slow down their degeneration. In addition, it is important to provide support and training for family members, caregivers and home staff.</p>

              <p>We believe that if the elders can actively face the final stages of their lives, arrange a plan for the elders in advance so that the elders and their families can be relieved when facing the end of their lives and achieve a "complete life".</p>
