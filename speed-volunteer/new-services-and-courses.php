              <h3 class="text-orange">Service users' needs</h3>
              <p>Who are young people? In different countries and even the WHO definition is changing. Gradually, I realized that as one of the organizations serving the society, it cannot target a single service target, because there are too many and too many that need to be handled and assisted. If it is restricted to a certain age or target, people-oriented service goals cannot be achieved. Therefore, in response to the needs of different service users, we seek the assistance of different stakeholders to assist the needs of service users. What we hope is that we can truly achieve the needs from the cradle to the grave, which is also a unique factor that distinguishes us from other services.</p>
