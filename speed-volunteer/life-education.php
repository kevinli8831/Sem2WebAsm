              <p>Birth, old age, sickness, and death are the necessary stages of life. Death seems to be the end of the journey of life, but it can also be regarded as the graduation ceremony of life. If the elders can actively face the final stages of their lives, arrange a plan for the elders in advance so that the elders and their families can be relieved and feel complete when facing the end of their lives.</p>

              <p class="text-orange">â€‹Our services:</p>

              <p>- Organize life and death education seminars (e.g. introducing different funerals, organ and body donations, advance wills, advance medical instructions and enduring power of attorneys, etc.) in Hong Kong<br>
                - Organizing trips (such as visiting the Heheshi Cemetery, sea burial, Changsheng shop, cremation ground, etc.)<br>
                - Referral service (only applicable to the elderly who have no relatives)</p>
